The original implementation of the article was based on TensorFlow, but I reproduced it using PyTorch.I trained a relatively correct model and applied the model to get some results. I also conducted interesting experiments using the same model on other datasets, and if you are interested, you can take a look at [my report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ib-QHUZJAq4R_qBBIyCNOE_1Q2LL9gYn/view) for CSE274.
