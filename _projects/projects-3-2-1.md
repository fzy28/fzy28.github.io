I try a novel approach of performing inverse rendering using SGGX and Microflake theory. And I use the TensoRF as the acceleration structure.

Results are not quite satisfying, and the original NeMF paper does not publish their codes and dataset.

Here is my [full report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Njz5pcKY80VmBV8c7CCWfJwIVl6bSYPr/view?usp=drive_link).
