This was a small game I developed before joining Tencent. At the time, I was obsessed with playing Ghost Runner, so I wanted to create a stealth game set within a cyberpunk worldview. So, I collaborated with my classmates on this project. I was mainly responsible for the gameplay and the graphics of the game. In terms of coding, I handled the movement and stealth assassination modules, while the enemy and UI modules were written by my friends.
