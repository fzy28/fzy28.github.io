I am a research intern @[SU Lab](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/), UC San Diego. I just received my master degree in Computer Science from UC San Diego, advised by [Prof. Tzumao-Li](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tzli/). 

My research interests lie in rendering, reconstruction and generative models(e.g. normalizing flows and diffusion model). I am looking for a Ph.D. position Fall 2025.

I received B.Eng. degree from College of Computer Science & Technology, Zhejiang University and Honours Degree from Chu Kochen Honors College in 2022, advised by [Prof. Rui Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yUxnN_EAAAAJ&hl=en). 

During my undergraduate years, I was a passionate enthusiast of gamer and interned on the [Honor of Kings: World(王者荣耀：世界)](https://world.qq.com/) project  at [Timi Studio](https://www.timistudios.com/).


# Old day's dream


At the age of 16, I set a life goal for myself: to become a game producer and create my own games that would have a global impact. 

While I won't say this dream has been dead or lost, in recent years I did since find another more compelling and intriguing goal, and I've decided to dedicate my best years to this area instead of game development. 

I think I definitely will revisit my gaming aspirations someday in the future. But that's often how life goes - we find ourselves interested in many things, yet we can only choose one as our primary focus.


Besides, I like cooking and I really like Japanese anime and manga.
