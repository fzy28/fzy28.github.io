I am a second year master student of Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego. My research interests are in Computer Graphics. I received B.Eng. degree from College of Computer Science & Technology, Zhejiang University and Honours Degree from Chu Kochen Honors College in 2022, advised by [Prof. Rui Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yUxnN_EAAAAJ&hl=en). 

I worked with [Prof. Rui Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yUxnN_EAAAAJ&hl=en) on cloth rendering and rendering engine in the State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University and interned at [RaysEngine](https://www.raysengine.com/), the laboratory's collaborative company.

During my undergraduate years, I was a passionate enthusiast of rendering and my future dream was to create my own game. I interned on the [Arena of Valor: World(王者荣耀：世界)](https://world.qq.com/) project  at [Timi Studio](https://www.timistudios.com/), Tencent. It was a wonderful time that had a great impact on me(It changed me a lot).

At UCSD, I continue deepening my knowledge in rendering. I have been working on a rendering project with [Prof. Tzumao-Li](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tzli/) up to now. Beyond rendering, I have a strong interest in inverse rendering and 3D reconstruction. I interned at [SU Lab](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/) for a period of time. 

## Out of Research

I'm an enthusiast for mathematics. I enjoy watching educational math videos on YouTube and Bilibili. I'm deeply moved by the beauty of mathematics.

I love rock & roll. I play the saxophone and have once performed Cui Jian's "Rock 'n' Roll on the New Long March"(崔健的歌，新长征路上的摇滚).

I really like Japanese anime and manga. My favorite are Cowboy Bebop and K-On!.

Naturally, I am a passionate gamer. I even believe that my greatest talent might lie in playing games. When I was 15, I played League of Legends so well that I was invited for a trial for a junior training team to become a professional game player, though I refused for high school.

Besides, I like cooking.

## About Future

My thoughts have greatly changed over the two years from my senior year to now. 

I haven't really figured out what my true research interest for the future will be. I hope I can make it clear by the time I write my MS thesis. 

So I plan to take a gap year and if you are interested in me as a RA or interns, please contact me.
